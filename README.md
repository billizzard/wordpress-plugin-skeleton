# wordpress-plugin-skeleton
Skeleton for wordpress plugin with PSR2 standarts

To use this skeleton:

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Change all occurrences of 'Myusefulplugin' in the file names to your plugin name:
   - admin/MyusefulpluginAdmin.php
   - includes/*
   - languages/*
   - public/MyusefulpluginPublic.php
 
3. Change all occurrences of 'Myusefulplugin' in code (Ctrl + Shift + R in PhpStorm). Please note that if you upload a plugin to the official wordpress repository, the name must be long and consist of at least 2-3 words (not too short) to be unique.

4. Change all occurrences of "AuthorName", "AuthorEmail@email.com", "AuthorUri" to your name, email, your page.

5. If your plugin is commercial, delete or modify the LICENSE.txt file and change the license type in the README.txt file.
